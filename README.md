## Requesting/Receiving Data
- [x] A request can be made to my microservice by calling a getTime() method in your program which opens a ZMQ socket connection and sends a request. Optionally, the request may also send data to my microservice during this open connection.
- [x] Data can be received from my microservice by clicking the "Send Time to Client" button in Project AlarmClock. This will be picking up the call in a sendTime() method to get the current time and send it back before closing the ZMQ socket connection.
